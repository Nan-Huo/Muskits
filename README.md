# Muskit: Open-source music processing toolkits

Muskit is an open-source music processing toolkit. Currently we mostly focus on benchmarking the end-to-end singing voice synthesis and expect to extend more tasks in the future. Muskit employs [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) as a deep learning engine and also follows [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) and [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org/) style data processing, and recipes to provide a complete setup for various music processing experiments. The main structure and base codes are adapted from ESPnet (we expect to merge the Muskit into ESPnet in later stages)

## Key Features

### ESPnet style complete recipe
- Support numbers of `SVS` recipes in several databases (e.g., Kiritan, Oniku_db, Ofuton_db, Natsume database, CSD database)
- On the fly feature extraction and text processing

### SVS: Singing Voice Synthesis
- **Reproducible results** in serveral SVS public domain copora
- **Various network architecutres** for end-to-end SVS
  - RNN-based non-autoregressive model
  - Xiaoice
  - Sequence-to-sequence Transformer (with GLU-based encoder)
  - MLP singer (in progress)
  - Bytesing (in progress)
  - DiffSinger (to be published)
- Multi-speaker & Multilingual extention
  - Speaker ID embedding
  - Language ID embedding
  - Global sytle token (GST) embedding
- Various language support
  - Jp / En / Kr / Zh (in progress)
- Integration with neural vocoders
  - the style mathces the (PWG repo)[https://github.com/kan-bayashi/ParallelWaveGAN] with supports of various of vocoders
